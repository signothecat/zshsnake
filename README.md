## Features

- Play with ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è **arrow keys**, **W/A/S/D**, or **h/j/k/l**
- Runs on macOS and Linux terminals
- Lightweight and dependency-free

## Requirements

- Zsh 5.8+
- `stty` and `tput` (ncurses) _Falls back to ANSI escape sequences if `tput` is not available._

Notes: The snake body is rendered using Unicode block characters (`‚ñ†`). On ASCII-only terminals, the
display may be misaligned or garbled. This limitation is currently WIP.
